# RealisticAerialImageryStyleTransfer-dipl
Repository of my bachelors diploma thesis titled "Translating the style of aerial imagery of generated landscapes into a realistic look".

This repository contains the code, data, and results of my project. The project uses style transfer to translate the style of aerial imagery of generated landscapes into a realistic look. The code is implemented in Python using the PyTorch library. The data consists of aerial imagery of real landscapes and generated landscapes. The results show that the style transfer technique is able to produce realistic aerial imagery of generated landscapes.

The repository also includes a link to my thesis, which provides more details about the project.
